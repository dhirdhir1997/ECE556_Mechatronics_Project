# ECE556_Mechatronics_Project
Built a robot (UV) capable of parking, platooning and path tracking using EV3 and MATLAB

The objective of this task is to design and implement a PID controller for a Lego Mindstorms EV3 Unmanned Vehicle (UV) for path tracking and parking. Figure 1 shows an example of a path r with a block placed at the end of the path.

Each group will use the sensors, actuators, and control knowledge learned in the Mechatronics course to
perform the following tasks:
1. Path tracking - Implement a PID control for the UV to move from point A with coordinate (𝑥𝐴, 𝑦𝐴) to
Point B (𝑥𝐵 , 𝑦𝐵) as fast as possible by tracking a given path 𝑟;

2. Parking - Park as close as possible to the block (Point B) without touching it;
 
3. Platooning - The objective of this task is to implement a PID controller to regulate the UV speed to follow a moving UV in the
front and maintain a constant distance
